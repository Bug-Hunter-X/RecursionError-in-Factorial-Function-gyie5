This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive Python functions:  infinite recursion due to improper input handling. The `factorial.py` file contains a recursive factorial function that does not handle negative inputs, resulting in a `RecursionError`. The `factorialSolution.py` file provides a corrected version that gracefully handles negative inputs by returning an appropriate error message or value.
